    <h1>WHAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE?</h1>
    <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

   <h2>WHAT IS THE REASONS?</h2>
   <p>Capitalism is an economic and political system in which a country’s trading power and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.
In economic terms, money is the ultimate power, because, as Clower forcefully stated, 'money buys goods. In a market economy, you can get everything if you pay the price – and have the money. If you do not have the ultimate liquidity, in other words, the amount of money (means of payment), you must ask for credit.
The answer is that huge disparities in income and wealth translate into comparable disparities in political influence. To see how this works, let’s look at a fairly recent example: the budgetary Grand Bargain that almost happened in 2011.

<h2>SOLUTION </h2>
<p> Our solution to the promblem at hand is to spread awarness to the consumer who buy from the big oil corrperations that the are only adding to the problem of climate change. In order to get these big corperation to understand and begin to listen we need to "hurt their pockets" to show we mean business. To do so we decided to make a zoetrope to show how the earth will slowly begin to die more and more throught the generations if we dont fix the issue of pollution. </p>
